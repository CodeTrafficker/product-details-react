### React demo of a product details page 

This demo uses json file saved out from 

 https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json

 ... to populate a display grid of products, using flexbox for laying out mobile to desktop views (1 column, 2 columns, 3 columns).

And this single page should then open in your browser.
